<p>Hello. I'm Unbaguettable, also known as MINimumPain in some places. I enjoy coding, which is why this website exists. To be honest, there is not much else I can say! This is just a place to hold my projects on the web, and make them easier to access. So have a great time here, do Control + W if you hate me, and see you around!</p>
